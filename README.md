# Nightlife Coordination App

## Overview

This app allows users to search for local venues, indicate their attendance, get directions
and see each venues Yelp rating. The client leverages Angular v2.x and Typescript backed by 
a Node.js REST API and MongoDB datastore.

A demo version of this app is deployed at: [https://angular-nightlife.herokuapp.com](https://angular-nightlife.herokuapp.com)

Part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/cjsheets) curriculum based on the following user stories:

* As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

## Install

Clone this repository and install npm dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:cjsheets/angular-nightlife-app.git
cd angular-nightlife-app
npm install
```

### Setup API Access 

To access the Yelp API (v3, Fusion), [you'll need a key](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). Once registered, create
`/client/environment/environment.ts` and add your key:

```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  api_url: 'http://localhost:5000',
  yelp: {
    expires_in: 123456789,
    token_type: 'Bearer',
    access_token: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  }
};
```

To leverage social media authentication, you'll need to register for developer tokens from
[Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/),
[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/),
[Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=angular-nightlife),
[GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers), etc. Once registered, create
`/server/config/environment/development.env.js` from `production.env.js` and add keys where indicated.

## Run

First, start the Node.js server in development mode:

```
npm run express-dev
```

For client development, use angular-cli to launch the app:

```
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

For server development, build the client to `/dist`:

```
ng build
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
